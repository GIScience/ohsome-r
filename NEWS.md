# ohsome 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Changed behaviour of set_properties(): Removes properties parameter from query 
body by default, accepts "tags" and/or "metadata" as properties argument 
(multiple values provided as comma-separated character or character vector).
