Description: This ohsome R package grants access to the power of the ohsome API 
    from R. It lets you analyze the rich data source of the OpenStreetMap (OSM)
    history. You can retrieve the geometry of OSM data at specific points in 
    time, and you can get aggregated statistics on the evolution of OSM elements
    and specify your own temporal, spatial and/or thematic filters.
